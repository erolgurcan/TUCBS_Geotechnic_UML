# TUCBS_Geotechnic_UML

Under the coordination of the General Directorate of Geographic Information Systems, TUCBS data production standards have been determined in order to use and share geographic data between local governments, universities, public institutions and organizations in accordance with the principles of interoperability. In addition, updates/expansion extension studies continue in line with the needs of relevant stakeholders in geographic data themes. In this context, Geotechnical sub-data theme was prepared by using Unified Modeling Language within the geology theme, which is one of 32 geographical data themes defined in TUCBS. Geotechnical surveys are carried out during the design and construction stages of underground and surface engineering structures projects and components planned to be built in a certain regionarea, under safe and economic conditions, together with the disciplines of geology, geophysics and hydrogeology. In this context, the physical and mechanical properties of artificial or natural rock and soil materials are determined by laboratoriesy and/or in situ tests on the samples taken from the pits or geotechnical borehole studies. In this study, code lists (enumerations) related to package structures, application schemas, feature and data types created using Unified Modeling Language for Geotechnical Sub-data Theme are presented. As a result, the a standard spatial data structure and content of geotechnical studies carried out by different institutions and organizations for specific purposes, project-based exploration and a high-level classification system were created.
